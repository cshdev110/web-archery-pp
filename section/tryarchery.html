                    <h3>Archery With Disabilities</h3>
                    <p>The club supports archers with all abilities, including members competing at national and
                        international para-archery events and the Invictus Games. Club facilities include indoor
                        shooting facilities, paved disabled parking bays, an accessible toilet, and cement paths between
                        buildings. The grassed outdoor fields are also used by para-archers. Experienced instructors and
                        coaches can take you from novice through to international competitor and our members provide a
                        friendly, supportive environment. You will need to arrange your own carer if required. Please
                        <a href="../section/info.html">contact</a> us to discuss your requirements.
                    </p>

                    <p>As a sport, archery can cater for a range of disabilities and visual impairments. Therefore the
                        club wholeheartedly welcomes and encourages people with a disability or visual impairment to
                        join. All newcomers to BTAC must do our Archery Course before being accepted as a club member.
                        Courses are usually held on our outdoor field from 7.45 &#45; 11.30am on the first Saturday of
                        each month, all equipment inclusive. In the event of inclement weather, courses go ahead in the
                        onsite indoor facility. An induction session is held from 8:00am &#45; 11:30am on the Saturday
                        following for course attendees who would like to join the club.
                    </p>

                    <p>All beginners, including those with a disability or vision impairment, undergo the same
                        instruction process on the same shooting line. If you require an assistant for your
                        participation, your assistant must do the Archery Course with you. This is for your safety and
                        also so that the assistant can receive instruction on how to become an archery assistant.
                    </p>

                    <p>The club requires advance warning about beginners who have a disability or visual impairment.
                        This will allow the club if necessary to allocate extra coaching or one-on-one coaching. Please
                        be aware that as BTAC is run solely by volunteers and volunteer coaches who give freely of their
                        time, our personnel resources are finite. This necessarily limits the number of disabled and
                        visually impaired archers that we can cater for at any one Archery Course.
                    </p>

                    <p>Archers who require an assistant and who decide to join the club as members must organise and
                        attend with their own assistant at all times. The club cannot undertake to provide assistants.
                        Assistants are required to join the club as Associate Members (non-shooting members) and can
                        attend the Archery Course free of charge. This ensures that the club meets its insurance
                        obligations and safety protocols are followed.
                    </p>

                    <p>Please see the <a href="../section/tryarchery.html">Archery Courses</a> section for further details and to <i>register</i> for the next course.
